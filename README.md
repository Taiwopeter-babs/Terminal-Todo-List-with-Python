# Mini Photo App with python
This mini application was built as a fun project for my students. 

In an ever changing world, opportunities are around us and with the right tools and skills, we can effect positive changes in our communities.

I believe that introducing technology early to African youngsters - with the right education - will go a long way in creating a continent-wide talent pool, boost the economy, solve the most challenging problems one click at a time, and increase our global output to positively impact coming generations. This was my motivation while building the application.

The tkinter library was used to display the graphical interface and Python Imaging Library (PIL) was used for processing.

## Screenshots of the App
The back button is disabled on getting to the first image, and the window size is not set for resizing to keep image quality, and the forward button is disabled on getting to the final image. The ```Exit Images``` button allows you exit the application.

This mini photo album was named _Jhene to Klaus_ because of the first image (Jhene Aiko) and last image (Joseph Morgan) - Klaus is a character in "The Originals" played by Joseph Morgan.
