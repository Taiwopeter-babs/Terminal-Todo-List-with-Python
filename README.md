# Mini Photo App with python
This mini application was built as a fun project for my students. 

In an ever changing world, opportunities are around us and with the right tools and skills, we can effect positive changes in our communities.

I believe that introducing technology early to African youngsters - with the right education - will go a long way in creating a continent-wide talent pool, boost the economy, solve the most challenging problems one click at a time, and increase our global output to positively impact coming generations. This was my motivation while building the application.

The tkinter library was used to display the graphical interface and Python Imaging Library (PIL) was used for processing.
